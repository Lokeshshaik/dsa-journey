🚀  dsa-journey

📚  My complete journey of learning **Data Structures & Algorithms**, with code solutions, notes, and progress tracking.

📁 Folder Structure
- [Arrays](./Arrays/)
- [Strings](./Strings/)
- [Graphs](./Graphs/)


Each folder will contain:
- ✅ Code solutions (`.java`)
- 📄 Problem links
- 🧠 Brief explanations (as comments or notes)

📌 My Goals
- Solve 400+ DSA problems (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)
- Understand each topic deeply
- Build confidence for coding interviews

🛠️ How to Use
1. Browse topic folders (e.g., `Arrays/`, `Trees/`)
2. Open `.java` files for code
3. Check comments for logic explanation

📅 Progress Tracker
| Topic             | Status         |
|-------------------|--------------  |
| Arrays            | ✅ Completed   |
| Strings           | ⏳ In Progress |
| Trees             | ❌ Not Started |
| Graphs            | ❌ Not Started |
