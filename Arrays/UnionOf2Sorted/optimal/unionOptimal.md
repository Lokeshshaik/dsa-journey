# ⚡ Optimal: Union Using Two Pointers

### Steps:
1. Traverse both arrays with two pointers.
2. Compare elements and skip duplicates.
3. Add only unique values to the result list.

### Time Complexity:
- O(n + m) — linear traversal of both arrays.

### Space Complexity:
- O(1) extra (ignoring output list).

### Note:
- Arrays must be **sorted** before applying this logic.
